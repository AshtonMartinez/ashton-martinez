      - "Wingtrex is a startup platform created with a fellow developer to help private pilots find suitable flying clubs and aircraft to rent. At the same time, it supports clubs in managing their aircraft listings and connecting with pilots who meet their criteria."
      - "The core idea behind Wingtrex is to make the process of finding and renting aircraft more accessible and transparent. We wanted to offer something that works well for both sides—pilots looking for availability and clubs looking for reliability."
      - "Since the platform is still early in its development, it currently focuses on the essentials: connecting users with available planes and clubs. But we’re planning future expansions, including features for rental schedule management, as well as tools to help student pilots coordinate with instructors more easily."
      - "We're building this project iteratively, with an eye toward keeping it practical, scalable, and helpful for the pilot community."

    paragraphs:
      - "We chose Vue for the frontend because the app requires a lot of interactivity, especially around aircraft listings, filtering, and account management. Vue's reactive components and smooth integration with Tailwind made it a solid fit for this type of project."
      - "Tailwind CSS helped us keep the UI consistent while moving quickly with layout and styling. It's especially helpful in early-stage projects where rapid iteration is important."
      - "Supabase powers the backend. It offers a reliable, scalable solution with built-in auth, user management, and a flexible database—all of which allowed us to focus more on building features rather than infrastructure. Its developer-friendly API and real-time features also make it a strong choice as the platform grows."
